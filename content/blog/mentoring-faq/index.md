## Technical Leadership

### I Feel I Am Programming Less And Less \[As A Tech Lead], Is This Normal?

Yes. Technical leaders are moving to a path where you are no longer just
producing software i.e. an individual contributor.

### What Skills Do I Need to Be A Tech Lead?

I think there are fundamentally 3 skills that you need to develop:

1. Leadership skills, being technical or not technical
1. System Design and Architecture skills, 
1. Developer skills, which you may already have

## Architecture

### As An Architect, Should I Still Develop Software?

Yes. Undoubtedly you don't want to become the proverbial [Ivory Tower 
Architect][2]. If you detach from programming completely, most probably
your solutions will also be detached from the code teams produce and
thus it becomes counterproductive because developers will be forced
to retrofit your solution instead of fit it more organically.
