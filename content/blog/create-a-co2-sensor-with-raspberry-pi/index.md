I recently wanted to introduce my daughters to the programming, so I decided
to use some kind of sensor to prototype a small application and teach them
how to make hardware and software work in tandem as I believe having something
physical would be more interesting than me typing on a REPL.

Now, I knew a raspberry pi had a way to connect sensors using its [General-purpose
input/output][1] pins, so I decided to build a non-trivial application to 
get used to the programming model and at the same time have experience to build 
something more complex later.

## Hardware Required

To start the project I did some research for sensors and while there were quite a
bit of choices, I got interested in the [KeyEstudio CCS811 Carbon Dioxide/ Air Quality 
Sensor for Arduino][2] which is compatible with Raspberry Pi 5V pins. It also works 
using the [I²C communication bus][3] which is also supported.

Now, in order to prototype faster, I got a [T-type breakout, a solderless board, and
rainbow cable, plus jump wires][4]. With this at hand, I was able to start interfacing 
the GPIO with the sensor.

## Wiring It All Together

Now, it was a while (since my college days) that I had work on a solderless board but
fortunately there is a diagram to connect the sensor to an arduino board thus you
can deduce how to wire it to the equivalent pins on a Raspberry Pi.

With this diagram, and the official Raspberry Pi documentation, I was able to find the
correct pins without much issue. For reference, here is the Raspberry Pi GPIO pin
diagram (this is for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B).

Finally, with the help of the T-type breakout, and the solderless board, here is a picture
of the connections. Note that the breakout already labels the pins so is not hard
to match them.

## Validate Connections To Raspberry Pi with i2cdetect

Now, with everything wired, the fastest way to detect if the sensor is properly interfacing
to the I²C bus is to run a utility which can be installed on the Raspberry Pi Os named
[`i2cdetect`][5]. Here is the command:

```shell script

pi@elderserver:~ $ i2cdetect -y 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 5a -- -- -- -- --
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

```

The way to interpret the output of the command and the parameters is the following:

*  `i2cdetect` takes a positional argument named I²C bus, in this case it maps to a
    linux device by number depending on your board. On the Raspberry Pi 4, it is the
    device number 1 located at `/dev/i2c-1`. The `-y` option is to disable the interactive
    mode.

*  The output of command represents the bus addresses in which the detected components
   can be found. In this case, the only address responding is `5a`, which is the
   address in which the CO2 sensor will respond. You can find more details in the
   datasheet of the [CCS811 sensor][6].
