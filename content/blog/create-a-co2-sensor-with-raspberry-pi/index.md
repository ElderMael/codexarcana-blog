I recently wanted to introduce my daughters to the programming, so I decided
to use some kind of sensor to prototype a small application and teach them
how to make hardware and software work in tandem as I believe having something
physical would be more interesting than me typing on a REPL.

Now, I knew a raspberry pi had a way to connect sensors using its [General-purpose
input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) pins, so 
I decided to build a non-trivial application to get used to the programming model
and at the same time have experience to build something more complex later.

## Hardware Required

To start the project I did some research for sensors and while there were quite a
bit of choices, I got interested in the [KeyEstudio CCS811 Carbon Dioxide/ Air Quality 
Sensor for Arduino](https://www.keyestudio.com/keyestudio-ccs811-carbon-dioxide-temperature-air-quality-sensor-for-arduino-p0581.html)
which is compatible with Raspberry Pi 5V pins. It also works using the 
[IÂ²C communication bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) which is also supported.

Now, in order to prototype faster, I got a [T-type breakout with a solderless board and
some cables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DL25MVQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
With this at hand, I was able to start interfacing the GPIO with the sensor.
